            <p class="sub-text">One of my favorite activities is cooking. I first learned how to cook when I was 9
                years old. As a kid, I experimented with ingredients and styles of cooking until I
                found what worked best for my tastes. Ever since then it’s been a life-long
                journey of self-discovery and epiphanies. As an adult, I have not lost my passion
                for cooking and have shared a few of my favorite recipes that I like to prepare.</p>

                    <p class="description">Italian Sautéed Eggplants is a delicious side dish prepared with eggplants,
                        cherry tomatoes and simple seasonings. Melanzane al funghetto (sautéed eggplant) is a typical
                        dish from the Campania region in Italy. This dish is served mainly as an accompaniment to meat,
                        fish or seafood recipes, although it is also common to serve it as a simple lunch with a good
                        homemade bread.</p>

                        favorite snack for parties and gatherings. Instead of vegetables like a traditional
                        hummus, I it like a fruit dip and serve it with strawberries, pineapple, green apple
                        slices, and my favorite: salty pretzels. It really is the best!</p>

                        and may use brown, red, yellow, green or black lentils, with or without the husk. Dehulled
                        yellow and red lentils disintegrate in cooking, making a thick soup. It is a staple food
                        throughout Europe,</p>
